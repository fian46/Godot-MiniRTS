Hey it is a card battle mobile game written with GODOT Engine.
Currently using GODOT HL Networking but in the future if webrtc available in GODOT it is gonna be epic. if you interested to make more unit try to extends Agent.tscn and create your own card. override state_machine() function and make some basic AI. you can peek how it works at Skeleton.tscn for basic buffer sync berween host and client. the rest is simple rpc call.
